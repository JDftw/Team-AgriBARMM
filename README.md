# Team-AgriBARMM
BARMM Data Challenge 2020

Agriculture plays an important role in BARMM. It has been resilient during the times of COVID-19 Pandemic. It is not merely a source of livelihood but a way of life. The potential of the agricultural sector in promoting economic development must be taken into account, as it provides not only food security but also an income to the BARMM community.

This project aims to build an agricultural monitoring dashboard (this includes crop, livestock, poultry and fishery) which will show LGU and the community how their production has developed through time. This will help disseminate information and identify areas of improvement through data-driven decision making for the people of BARMM.
